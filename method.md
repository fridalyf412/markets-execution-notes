# Method & Rules (FX Execution Notes)

## Goal
Build execution intuition + communication quality:
- identify plausible drivers of moves
- articulate risks and “what would change my view”
- highlight key levels/events relevant to execution
- keep a consistent, skimmable format

## Scope
Primary: FX (G10)
Optional context: US 2Y/10Y yields (only when relevant)

## Sources (public)
Use reputable public sources only:
- central bank releases/calendars
- economic data calendars
- mainstream financial news summaries

## Style rules
- Max 1 page per note
- Separate facts vs hypotheses
- No prediction/alpha language
- Always include: (1) what moved (2) drivers (3) hypothesis (labeled) (4) what would change my view (5) execution watchlist
